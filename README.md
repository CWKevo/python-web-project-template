# Python project template

A template for new Python projects.

## Features

- Automatically builds [PDoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) documentation & uploads package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org) on new GitHub release, thanks to GitHub actions;
- Tests with pyTest before uploading to PyPI (or you can test manually with `workflow-dispatch`);
- Ready-to-go `setup.py` file;
- Scripts to build documentation and compile as a Python package;
- A to-do list below;
- Possibly more ;)
